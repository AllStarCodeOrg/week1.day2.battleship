# week1.day2.battleship

## Instructions
1. Use command line to create a new project folder called `battleship`
    - Navigate into the folder and create your required files (`index.html`, `sketch.js`) 
    - Include a reference to p5.js in your `index.html` file
2. Follow the plan you made with your team!
3. Remember:
    - The board should be a 10x10 grid.
    - When the grid loads it should have 'ships' laid out in certain positions, which are unknown to the user.
    - When the user clicks on a box, it should change color revealing whether or not it is a 'hit'.
4. This is a very open project with the goal being to get as much done as possible in the allotted time.
    - *Note: working within a tight deadline like this and getting the most critical components working is an important tech skill*

## Extra Credit
- Create a way for the user to reset the board
- Create a way to track the user's score
